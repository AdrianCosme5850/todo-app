## Approach  

Modularized these components and added some styling from blueprint. Also added pagination to display only the first three tasks. I used context where applicable along with a couple of instances of use state.  

## Lab 32  

## Approach  

Implemented a settings drop down that controls pagination, alphabetical order sort, and hide/show completed tasks. Tried to get some tests running, but couldn't get them to run with the test command. Not sure why it isn't recognizing them, but it says that it doesn't detect any changes since the last commit even after a commit.
